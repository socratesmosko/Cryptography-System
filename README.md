# Password Encryption and Decryption using Caesar Cipher in Python

This project is a simple implementation of password encryption and decryption using the Caesar cipher algorithm. The Caesar cipher is a substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

# Usage

To use this program, simply run the machine() function. The function will ask the user to enter a password and select an encryption mode (Encode or Decode). The program will then encrypt or decrypt the password using the Caesar cipher algorithm and print the result.
